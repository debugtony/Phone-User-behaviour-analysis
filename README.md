## 📱 User Behavior Classification

 A project to classify smartphone users based on their usage patterns. Using data analysis and machine learning, this project identifies different behavioral groups, useful for enhancing user experience and creating targeted strategies.

Project Overview
This project analyzes smartphone usage data to categorize users based on their interaction patterns like app usage time, screen-on time, and data usage.

Key Steps:
Descriptive Analysis: Summarizes and visualizes data to understand trends.

Correlation Analysis: Examines relationships between features using a heatmap.

Classification: Uses a Random Forest Classifier to accurately classify users into behavior groups.
