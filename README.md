📱 User Behavior Classification and Analysis
This project aims to classify smartphone users based on their interaction patterns using data analysis and machine learning techniques. It provides insights into how users engage with their devices, which can inform user experience design, marketing strategies, and product personalization.

🔍 Project Overview
Understanding user behavior is essential for creating targeted, data-driven strategies. By analyzing patterns in app usage time, screen-on time, data usage, and other smartphone interaction metrics, this project demonstrates how to effectively classify users into distinct behavioral groups.

Key Components:
Descriptive Analysis: Data exploration, including statistical summaries and visualizations, to understand trends and distributions.
Correlation Analysis: Heatmap visualization to uncover relationships between features, helping to identify potential predictors for user classification.
Classification Model: Implementation of a Random Forest Classifier to categorize users, achieving high accuracy in predicting behavioral classes.

🧩 Analysis & Results
1. Descriptive Analysis
Analyzed the distribution of app usage time, screen-on time, and data usage to understand user engagement. This step identified key trends and detected outliers, providing a solid foundation for classification.

2. Correlation Analysis
A heatmap was generated to visualize correlations between features. We observed notable correlations between app usage time and screen-on time, among others, which helped in feature selection for the model.

3. User Behavior Classification
A Random Forest Classifier was trained to classify users into behavioral segments. The model achieved high accuracy, as demonstrated by the classification report and confusion matrix.
